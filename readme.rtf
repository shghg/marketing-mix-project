Marketing Mix Analysis with Python – AI/ML Bootcamp Project
📊 Overview
This project is part of my AI & Machine Learning Bootcamp, where I conducted a comprehensive data analysis on a marketing campaign dataset. The goal was to explore customer behavior, evaluate marketing performance, and extract actionable business insights based on the 4 Ps of marketing — Product, Price, Place, Promotion — along with People.
🎯 Objectives
	•	Perform data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
	•	Visualize distributions and detect outliers using boxplots and histograms
	•	Apply IQR-based outlier treatment
	•	Encode categorical variables using ordinal and one-hot encoding
	•	Conduct hypothesis testing to validate marketing assumptions
	•	Generate insights using correlation heatmaps and visualizations
📁 Dataset
The dataset includes demographic data, product purchases, marketing campaign responses, and channel preferences for over 2,000 customers. Key columns include:
	•	Income, Education, Marital_Status, Year_Birth
	•	MntWines, MntFruits, ..., MntGoldProds (Product spending)
	•	NumWebPurchases, NumCatalogPurchases, NumStorePurchases
	•	Response (whether a customer accepted the last campaign)
🛠️ Key Tasks Performed
✅ 1. Data Cleaning
	•	Removed formatting from Income (e.g., "$84,000") and converted to float
	•	Parsed Dt_Customer as a datetime object
	•	Imputed missing income values using group averages by Education and Marital_Status
✅ 2. Feature Engineering
	•	Total_Children = Kidhome + Teenhome
	•	Age = Current Year - Year_Birth
	•	Total_Spending = Total product spending
	•	Total_Purchases = Sum of all purchases from web, catalog, and store
✅ 3. Outlier Detection and Treatment
	•	Used IQR method to cap outliers
IQR = Q3 - Q1
Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
✅ 4. Encoding Categorical Variables
	•	Applied ordinal encoding for Education
	•	Applied one-hot encoding for Country and Marital_Status
✅ 5. Hypothesis Testing
	•	Are older customers more likely to shop in-store?
	•	Do customers with children prefer online shopping?
	•	Is there cannibalization between store and online channels?
	•	Does the US outperform other countries in purchase volume?
✅ 6. Visualizations & Insights
	•	Correlation heatmap
	•	Product revenue rankings
	•	Response rates by age, children, and geography
	•	Complaints by education background
📌 What I Learned
	•	Practical feature engineering for marketing data
	•	Real-world missing value imputation strategies
	•	Statistical hypothesis testing (t-tests, Pearson correlation)
	•	Importance of visualization in business storytelling
